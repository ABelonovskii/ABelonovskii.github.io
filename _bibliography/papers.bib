ABSTRACT = {Control of directionality of emissions is an important task for the realization of novel nanophotonic devices based on nanowires. Most of the existing approaches providing high directionality of the light emitted from nanowires are based on the utilization of the tapered shape of nanowires, serving as nanoantenna coupling with the light waveguided in nanowire and the directional output beam. Here we report the beaming of the emitted light with wavelength near 800 nm by naturally formed core-shell AlGaAs NW with multiply GaAs quantum dots (QDs) diameter 30 nm and height 10 nm, while the diameter of NW 130 nm, what does not support efficient emission into waveguided modes, including the mode HE11. Experimental measurements show that intensity of emission for directions in the vicinity of the axis of NW is about two orders of magnitude higher than for perpendicular directions. The developed theoretical approach allowed us to calculate the probability of spontaneous emission for various directions and into waveguided modes and showed that highly directional radiation can be provided by the intrinsic emission properties of cylindrical NW. Our results suggest that for the small diameter of NW, directional emissions are associated with an TM0 leaky mode (when electric field oriented in axial direction) and therefore manifests in an existence of axial electric dipole transitions in quantum dots.},

abstract = { Excitons in organic semiconductors possessing a large oscillator strength demonstrate strong coupling with cavity modes at room temperature. A large Stokes shift in some organic semiconductors enriches and complicates the picture of the emission in strongly coupled systems of organic excitons and light. Here, we demonstrate strong coupling of excitons in 4,4-bis(N-carbazolyl)-1,1-biphenyl (CBP) and Tamm plasmons in the ultraviolet (UV) band, accompanied by a bright emission from the structure. Reflection measurements demonstrate the pronounced formation of the lower and upper polariton modes with Rabi splitting of the magnitude of 0.3 eV, and the emission peak experiences a substantial red shift with respect to the lower polariton mode. Both radiative and nonradiative decay rates in the Tamm plasmon CBP structure are increased with respect to a bare CBP. Such peculiar behavior is attributed to the simultaneous manifestation of strong coupling and weak coupling of the CBP molecule emitters to the Tamm plasmons. },

abstract = {Fabrication of microcavities based on III-nitrides is challenging due to difficulties with the coherent growth of heterostructures having a large number of periods, at the same time keeping a good precision in terms of thickness and composition of the alloy. A planar design for GaN microresonators supporting whispering gallery modes is suggested. GaN hexagonal microstructures are fabricated by selective-area metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy using focused ion beam for mask patterning. Low-temperature cathodoluminescence spectra measured with a high spatial resolution demonstrate two dominant emission lines in the near bandgap region. These lines merge at room temperature into a broad emission band peaking at ≈3.3 eV, which is shifted toward lower energies compared with the reference excitonic spectrum measured for the GaN layer. A numerical analysis of exciton–polariton modes shows that some strongly localized cavity modes can have high Purcell coefficients and can strongly interact with the GaN exciton.},

abstract = { The properties of the ultrastrongly coupled Tamm plasmon cavity filled with a high-oscillator-strength organic material DPAVBi (4,4′-bis[4-(di-p-tolylamino)styryl]biphenyl) are studied using theoretical and experimental methods. An analytical model predicts the opposite sign of polarization splitting for the lower and upper polariton cases and a giant absolute value of the splitting. A set of organic Tamm plasmon cavities with different detuning parameters are fabricated. We demonstrate that all structures are operating in the ultrastrong coupling regime: the values of the Rabi splitting are close to a 20\% fraction of the exciton energy. The measured angle-dependent reflectivity spectra structure for both transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) polarizations confirm the predicted theoretical model. We obtained a giant value of the polarization splitting of up to 180 meV for both polariton branches. We believe that it is the first demonstration of such peculiar polarization splitting behavior of polaritons in the ultrastrong coupling regime. },

In meso-cavities, the frequency interval between the optical modes is comparable or smaller than the value of the Rabi splitting between the exciton and the optical modes. The Hamiltonian of the interaction between the exciton and the cavity modes is constructed, and it is shown that such an interaction between the cavity modes and the exciton can occur both in weak and in strong coupling regimes. The latter case can be accompanied by a pronounced splitting of the emission peaks as shown for modelled meso-cavities of triangular, square and hexagonal shapes, where it is demonstrated that Q-factors for the adjacent cavity modes as well as the strength of interaction with excitons can differ by few orders of magnitude.},

abstract = {Limits on the value of the spins of supermassive black holes (SMBH) in Seyfert-type active galactic nuclei (AGN) are calculated using two hybrid models for the generation of relativistic jets: the Meier model and a model of tandem Blandford-Znajek and Blandford-Payne processes. A comparison of our calculations with limits on the spin obtained by x-ray reflection spectroscopy shows that they are in good agreement for the tandem model. This shows that the magnetic field pressure is roughly equal to the radiation pressure in the accretion disk in the region of the last stable orbit. The magnitudes of the magnetic fields at the radii of the last stable orbit in the accretion disk and the event horizon of a supermassive black hole are also determined for objects in a list of 28 radio quasars. The important result is that the magnetic energy density near the radius of the event horizon turns out to be significantly higher than the energy density of the accretion gas. This may indicate the existence of a mechanism for amplification of the magnetic field near the event horizon of black holes located in the center of powerful radio quasars.},

With the help of genetic optimization algorithms, the structures of multilayer semiconductor and combined metal-semiconductor reflectors were obtained, having a smaller thickness and equal optical characteristics than those of classical analogues. In particular, a 29% reduction in the thickness of the silicon/silica Bragg reflector was achieved without compromising performance.},

The structure under study consists of a CBP layer of a given thickness sandwiched between two silver layers, two thin phase-matching CBP layers (dph = 26 nm), and two quarter-wave Bragg reflectors. It is shown that hybrid modes localized in the central layer of the structure can significantly increase the luminescence decay rate of an organic emitter due to the Purcell effect. It is found that the spectral positions of the hybrid modes are shifted because of their interaction with exciton resonance in CBP. This may indicate the emergence of a strong coupling regime.},

The results show that for spheres of sufficiently large radii, several plasmon modes can be localized on their surface at once, which makes them possible for strong coupling with an exciton. The calculated spectra confirm that plasmon modes can effectively interact with excitons in the surrounding organic material, which leads to a significant change in both the absorption and emission characteristics of the system.

PQCs are characterized by the long-range order and lack of periodicity. Such systems have also peculiar optical properties, eg the fractal density of photonic states and the light localization determined by this—even in 1D case [3–5]. The Tamm plasmons (TP) are electromagnetic states localized at the edge between the dielectric Bragg mirror and the metal. TP modes differ from conventional surface plasmon. They have some useful advantages like the existence inside the light cone (both in TE and TM polarizations) and lower absorption losses. The use of metallic structures with photonic quasicrystal can lead to promising optical phenomena [6]. The topological properties of the TP-like state have been recently studied in a 1D photonic quasicrystal [7]. In this paper we theoretically study the hybrid Tamm plasmon—photonic quasicrystal cavity with an organic small molecule active layer. Light emission enhancement properties of this system and its general optical properties are analyzed.},
