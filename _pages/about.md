Hi! I’m Alexey — a physicist and scientific software developer specializing in photonics, quantum optics, and AI-driven modeling.
I am passionate about bridging physics, engineering, and artificial intelligence to develop innovative solutions in photonics and materials science.

My background combines academic research in nanophotonics and light–matter interaction with hands-on experience in scientific software development for optical simulation, signal processing, and data automation.

I also built a strong engineering career, including work as a Senior Software Engineer at [Tungsten Automation](https://www.tungstenautomation.com/), where I focused on developing critical production systems and scientific tools.

My main areas of interest include:

- `Photonics`
- `Quantum Optics`
- `Numerical Simulation`
- `Python, C#, С++`
- `Artificial Intelligence`

I am enthusiastic about applying my interdisciplinary background to cutting-edge research and technology development.
Feel free to explore my [publications](https://abelonovskii.github.io/publications/), [projects](https://abelonovskii.github.io/repositories/), and [short CV](https://abelonovskii.github.io/cv/).
I am always open to new collaborations, innovation-driven projects, and scientific discussions.
