Hi! I’m Alexey. I completed my postgraduate studies at the Alferov University and successfully defended my PhD dissertation at ITMO University in December 2021. My dissertation, titled "Modification of the probability of spontaneous emission in plasmonic, organic and semiconductor nanostructures", was supervised by [Dr. M. Kaliteevski](https://www.webofscience.com/wos/author/record/M-1308-2016).

Alongside my academic career, I have pursued a parallel career in programming. Currently, I am a Senior Software Engineer at [Tungsten Automation](https://www.tungstenautomation.com/). 

My main areas of interest include:

- `Quantum Optics`
- `Photonics`
- `Numerical Simulation`
- `Python, C#`
- `Artificial Intelligence`

I am delighted to apply my knowledge in physics and software engineering to work on innovative projects. My experience in both fields allows me to approach problems from both perspectives.

Feel free to connect with me on social media or check out my publications and recent projects. I am always open to new collaborations and discussions.
